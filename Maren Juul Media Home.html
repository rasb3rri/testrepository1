		<h2>Welcome to Maren Juul Media</h2>
		<br/>
		<aside>
		<p>Hello! My name is Maren and I'm an internet content creator. I am interested in all aspects of website creation and marketing. My goal is to join other IT professionals in creating websites, SEO, and other digital content such as logos and design elements. I think the internet is a fantastic place and I would love to help your organization flourish!</p>
		<p>This website serves as an example of my skills, as well as links to my contact info and projects. All the content, art and code for this site was created by me.

		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>In this online portfolio, I have created some examples of work and links to active websites I own as well as downloadable content I have created and is currently for sale. On this portfolio website you will find an example product page, an example blog page with multimedia like embedded video.</p>
		<h3>WordPress Projects</h3>
		<p>Currently, I have a few examples of ecommerce websites that are linked <here> and <here>. I made these in 2022 and I have created all of the content for both except product photos and specifications which were obtained from the wholesale website. 
		There is a lot that goes into a project like these sites. I begin with research to determine the niche and proper keywords to use as well as which products to add to the website. I do have a few blog posts on each of these sites as they assist my website authority on search engines and increase traffic to the websites. I have had traffic since day one!</p>

		<h3>How I Create Online Content</h3>
		<p>In case you're also a creator and you would like my input, then please read on to discover which software I choose to use. Shockingly, yes, its all free!!</p>
		<p>I believe that Open Source software is superior to paid versions for a few reasons. First, anyone can easily learn to use these programs by searching for free resources on sites like YouTube, there are tons of creators out there who have already provided thousands of tutorials and blogs to read. I am certain that its possible for beginners to create beautiful websites and digital art with a very minimal investment in hosting and domains.</p>
		<h3>Open Source Tools for Design and Copywriting</h3>
		<p>All of the software I enjoy using is Open Source. This means the software was created under copyright licenses which allows a user to use, view and change the code of the software as they wish. </p>
		<p>For this site, I decided to write my own HTML and CSS directly, just to give you an idea of what I can do for you. I've created this website from scratch in an open source program known as Notepad++. Unfortunately this program can be dangerous to download due to hackers adding their own malware to the download and creating chaos for the user. The malware was known as StrongPity. Thankfully, this virus can be avoided by downloading the Notepad++ program from a reputable source. For this reason, I will only recommend you visit this link to their official website: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/.</p>
		<p>Second, you should know, I've created all the art and design elements on this website with a few Open Source programs, InkScape and Krita and GIMP. These three replace Adobe programs and most people doing reviews out there agree, these are very valuble, powerful programs that are easy to use. I higly recommend Krita for anyone that likes to paint, it works very well with a drawing tablet and the brushes are very realistic and you can customize practically any parameter.</p>
		<p>My favorite program for logo design is Inkscape, its a lot like Adobe Illustrator. You can use it to create vector graphics, trace png images and it was really easy to learn the basics by using tutorials on YouTube, I would highly recommend these for beginners who like apps like Canva and want more functionality. The only thing that I feel is a negative, is that it tends to crash if you're working with scanned images and there are too many nodes, so I often use GIMP to clean up photos before importing them to InkScape to redraw them or trace. If you're looking to give these programs a try, then please check out these <links> for safe websites to download them from.</p>
